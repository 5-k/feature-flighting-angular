Feature Flighting is a reuseable node package which can be readily used with Angular applications to handle different feature flighting behaviours on UI components

  - Hide/Show a section, element, button , div
  - Redirect to a page
  - Redirect to unauthorized

# New Features!

  - Added Directive for implementing the feature with no dependencies


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

This is a reusable framework component for feature flighting on Angular,
In today's fast-paced, feature-driven markets, it's important to continuously deliver value and receive feedback on features quickly and continuously. Partnering with end users to get early versions of features vetted out is valuable.

> Are you planning to continuously integrate features into your application while they're under development? You probably have a few questions, such as:
How can you toggle features to hide, disable, or enable features at run-time?
How can you revert a change deployed to production without rolling back your release?
How can you present users with variants of a feature, to determine which one performs better?
